Sequence-to-function models have broad applications in interpreting the molecular impact of genetic variation, yet have been criticized for poor performance in this task. Here we show that training models on functional genomic data with matched personal genomes improves their performance at variant effect prediction. Variant effect representations are retained even when fine tuning models to unseen cellular contexts and experimental readouts. Our results have implications for interpreting trait-associated genetic variation.
