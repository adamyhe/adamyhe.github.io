About Me
======

I am a computational biologist/bioinformatician. My primary research interests lie in using machine learning models decipher how gene regulation is encoded in our genomes. I've also worked on variant effect and complex disease risk prediction.

Currently, I am a postdoc with Anshul Kundaje at Stanford. Previously, I did my PhD with Charles Danko at Cornell.
