I gave a spotlight talk and poster on our work improving variant effect prediction by training sequence to function models on personal genomes at [Machine Learning in Computational Biology 2024](https://sites.google.com/cs.washington.edu/mlcb2024/). Here is the [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgLlPo6dVV0&list=PL9Uzhlxi3pAOk4yUuuBaulLeQxeVfAGvW&index=7&t=596s) recording of my presentation. The preprint for this paper is on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.15.618510).
